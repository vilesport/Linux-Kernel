- I have update more features so that it easier for debugging
- You can change your `linux kernel` version, `busybox` version and your driver name at the top of `run.sh`
- `run.sh` would help you for doing anything:
  - With no argument, it will build `linux kernel`, `busybox` and `compile` your driver in `drivers` folder
  - `kernel`: build `linux kernel` only and copy `bzImage` to `files`
  - `busybox`: build `busybox` only, copy and setup everything for `initramfs`
  - `compile`: compile your driver in `drivers`
  - `run`: run the machine, make sure that `kernel`, `busybox` and `compile` have to run at least 1 time before run
  - `help`: display this help
- Your driver will be located in `drivers` folder. Just cd in there, `insmod` your drivers and debug
